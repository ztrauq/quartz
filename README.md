# Quartz

__Quartz__ is an internal project of Market Evaluator.

It sets out the guiding principles for development of Market Evaluator products in [MeteorJS](https://github.com/meteor/meteor).

__Quartz__ is motivated by the need to ensure consistency of approach in development. Using priniples will help the development team to optimise the code base and make it adoptable by new members to the team.

it is assumed that __Quartz__ projects are user interfaces which allow users to interact with data. To this end, __Quartz__ is user-centric focusing on a standardised and simple user experience.

### 1. Stateful UI

#### The `UI` is __stateful__
 
The __stateful__ approach to UI development is declarative. It describes what has already happened 

It is useful to contract this with the imperative paradigm which describes what to to do. For example consider a UI with a 'save' button. In the declarative paradigm when the button is clicked it may set a value 'user wants to save' and a something in the programme will start the
