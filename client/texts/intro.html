Flux is uni-directional pattern that has been designed for reactive web development. Although it was released alongside React, it is not really a thing in itself but a approach to coding. 
        
This demo was developed to apply the methods of flux, maintaining the uni-directional flow but in the Meteor workflow. Flux was developed to aid stateful UI development, de-coupling the logic from the view.


Flux has has 4 steps in its model
  - Action - responds to events, and set off the process for changing the state of a UI component
  - Dispatcher - handles Actions, identifying which single logic is delegated to handle the state
  - Store - holds the single programming logic to manage the state of componets
  - View - relatively watches the state and renders any changes as they occur

This demo was created to show how Flux can work in Meteor with Blaze and to provide an example of a declarative approach to stateful UI engineering.
